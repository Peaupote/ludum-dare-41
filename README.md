Ludum Dare 41
=============

Theme: Combine 2 Incompatible Genres
------------------------------------

Win condition:

* Build a top-tier building.

Lose condition:

* The spaceship die.

Controls
--------

To differentiate the 2 games let's say that the shoot them up requires only keyboard controls and the body simulation only mouse controls.

The shoot them up
-----------------

On the left side of the screen you control the spaceship travelling throught intergallatic space.

You must avoid

* damages from meteorites.
* blakholes and suns.
* pirates attacks.

You have 2 types of shooting

* big laser: single direction, verypowerful, expensive in energy
* turrets: fire lots of bullets in spiral but not very powerful

Life inside the ship
--------------------

This is a classic real-time simulation game.

Ressources:

* energy (shared with the spaceship)
* food
* mechanical components (you can build those or the ship can find some in the space)

Technological tree:

* Tiers 0:
  * House: needed to extends the supply limit and produce more workers.
  * Cantina: peoples go there to produce food
* Tiers 1:
  * Lab increase energy production

If the ship

* lose to much life at once it randomly damage buildings
* go to fast, peoples in the ship fall and slip: they randomly dies
